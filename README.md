> Everything that has to do with the neural network's connection with the eye.

## About

`vision` is a public project under the `shinychoes` organization focused on exploring and building systems around how neural networks interact with visual information—from raw pixels and eye-like sensors to higher-level perception.

This repository is intended as a home for experiments, tools, and components related to vision-centric neural network work.

- Organization: [shinychoes](https://github.com/shinychoes)
- Project: `vision`

## Project layout

The structure will evolve over time. Some notable areas:

- `UI_UX/`
  - Frontend, prototypes, or design assets.
  - See [`UI_UX/README.md`](UI_UX/README.md) for UI-specific notes.
- `Vision/`
  - Placeholder for core vision / neural network code.

Additional directories and modules will be documented here as the project grows.

## Getting started

> Note: These are generic guidelines; adapt them as the technical stack solidifies.

### Prerequisites

- A recent version of Git
- A recent version of your preferred programming language runtime (for example Python, Node.js, etc.), depending on which submodule you are working on
- Recommended: a virtual environment or isolated environment per language/tool

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinychoes/vision.git
cd vision
```

### Setup

Follow setup instructions in the subproject you are working on (for example, see `UI_UX/README.md` for UI-specific setup). As the core vision components stabilize, this section will be expanded with concrete steps.

## Usage

Usage, scripts, and example workflows will be documented here as the repository gains more concrete components (models, datasets, training scripts, demos, etc.).
