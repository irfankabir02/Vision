# Security Policy

This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities for `vision` under the `shinychoes` organization.

## Supported versions

Because `vision` may be in active development and experimentation, the security posture may evolve.

Unless stated otherwise in release notes, we generally focus on:

- The `main` branch
- The most recent tagged releases (if/when releases are published)

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security or privacy issue:

- **Do not** create a public GitHub issue or share the details publicly.
- Instead, report the issue privately by contacting the maintainers or organization owners for `shinychoes` (for example via contact information listed on the organization or related profiles).

When reporting, please include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Any potential impact you can identify
- Any suggested mitigation or fix ideas (optional but appreciated)

## What to expect

Once you report a vulnerability:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as reasonably possible.
2. We will investigate the issue and assess impact and severity.
3. We may ask follow-up questions to clarify details.
4. We will work on a fix or mitigation plan if the issue is confirmed.
5. We may coordinate a disclosure timeline with you, especially for higher-impact issues.

## Responsible disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue.
- Avoid publicly disclosing or exploiting the vulnerability before it has been resolved.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and the time and effort taken to help improve the security of `vision`.
