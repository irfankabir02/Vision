# Screenshots Dataset (Placeholder)

This folder will store sample dashboard/screen captures for screenshot-aware summarization.

- Keep images redacted or synthetic; no PII or sensitive data.
- Pair each image with a short description of layout/intent for future OCR/layout tests.
- Use lightweight formats (PNG/JPEG) and note expected budgets per profile.
