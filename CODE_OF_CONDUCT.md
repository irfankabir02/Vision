# Code of Conduct

This project, `vision`, under the `shinychoes` organization, follows a Code of Conduct inspired by the Contributor Covenant.

We aim to provide a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristics.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project-related communication channels where `vision` is discussed

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting project maintainers or the `shinychoes` organization owners.

When reporting, please provide:

- A description of what happened
- Links, screenshots, or other supporting material if possible
- Any additional context that might help us understand the situation

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

We will maintain the privacy of reporters to the extent possible.

## Enforcement guidelines

Project maintainers may take actions including but not limited to:

- A warning
- Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces
- Reverting or rejecting contributions

The specific action will depend on the severity and frequency of the behavior.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
